<blockquote style="max-width:70%; border-left: thick solid black; padding:1em; background: #EEE">
  He experienced both bliss and horror in contemplating the way an inclined line, rotating spokelike,
  slid upwards along another, vertical line&mdash;in an example illustrating the mysteries of parallelism.
  The vertical one was infinite, like all lines, and the inclined one, also infinite, sliding along it
  and rising ever higher as its angle decreased, was doomed to eternal motion, for it was impossible
  for it to slip off, and the point of their intersection, together with his soul, glided upwards
  along an endless path. But with the aid of a ruler he forced them to unlock: he simply redrew
  them, parallel to one another, and this gave him the feeling that out there, in infinity, where he
  had forced the inclined line to jump off, an unthinkable catastrophe had taken place, an inexplicable
  miracle, and he lingered long in those heavens where earthly lines go out of their mind.

    A polished black sedan was a good subject, especially if parked at the intersection of a tree-bordered street and
    one of those heavyish spring skies whose bloated grey clouds and amoeba-shaped blotches of blue
    seem more physical than the reticent elms and evasive pavement. Now break the body of the car into
    separate curves and panels; then put it together in terms of reflections. These will be different for each
    part: the top will display inverted trees with blurred branches growing like roots into a washily
    photographed sky, with a whalelike building swimming by&mdash;an architectural afterthought; one side of
    the hood will be coated with a band of rich celestial cobalt; a most delicate pattern of black twigs will
    be mirrored in the outside surface of the rear window; and a remarkable desert view, a distended
    horizon, with a remote house here and a lone tree there, will stretch along the bumper.

  Now it's the challenger's turn to reply to to this verbal bombardment:<br>
  Neatly each phrase he dissects. with intelligence subtle and keen;<br>
  Harmless around him the adjectives tumble, as he ducks for cover<br>
  And squeaks, 'It depends what you mean.'
