<blockquote style="flex: 60%;">
  The hardest knot is but a meandering string; tough to the finger nails, but really a matter of lazy and graceful loopings. The eye
  undoes it, while the clumsy fingers bleed. He (the dying man) was that knot, and he would be untied at once, if he could manage to
  see and follow the thread. And not only himself, everything woul be unravelled,&mdash;everything that he might imagine in our childish
  terms of space and time, both being riddles invented by man <em>as</em> riddles, and thus coming back at us: the boomerangs of nonsense &mldr;
  Now he had caught something real, which had nothing to do with any of the thoughts or feelings, or experiences he might have had in the kindergarten of life &mldr;

<blockquote>
  It will all be easier in a day or two<br/>
  When you have learned the proper system<br/>
  For reducing things and labelling them.

<blockquote>
  Out of swarms of drafts, long manuscript extracts from books, indecipherable jotting on miscellaneous sheets of
  paper, pencilled remarks straggling over the margins of other writings of mine; out of half-crossed-out sentences,
  and improvidently abbreviated already forgotten names, hiding from full view among my papers; out of the fragile
  staticism of irredeemable information, already destroyed in places by a too swift movement of thought, which in turn
  dissolved into nothingness; out of all this I must now make a lucid, orderly book. At times I feel that somewhere
  it has already been written by me, that it is here, hiding in this inky jungle, that I have only to free it part by
  part from the darkness and the parts will fall together of themselves... But what is the use of that to me when this
  labour of liberation now seems to me so difficult and complicated...

<blockquote>
  The knowledge of the adept embraces other fields, such as physiognosis, which deals with occult physics, the static, the dynamic, and
  the kinematic, or astrology and esoteric biology, the study of the spirits of nature, hermetic zoology. I could add cosmognosis,
  which studies the heavens from the astronomical, cosmological, physiological, and ontological points of view, and anthropognosis, which
  studies human anatomy, and the sciences of divination, psychurgy, social astrology, hermetic history. Then there is qualitative
  mathematics, arithmology...

<blockquote>
  It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone dilgently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact,
  that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.

  &ndash; Herman Melville, <i>Moby Dick</i>, p.377. Oxford University Press (2008).

<blockquote>
  Even when falling in love, the Great Priest of Shiga had not discarded the habit, to which he had trained himself during his long years of contemplation, of striving
  to approach the essence of things by means of constant abstraction.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  Yukio Mishima, <i>The Priest of Shiga Temple and His Love</i> (translated by Ivan Morris). In <i>Death in Midsummer</i>, p.81. Penguin (2024).

<blockquote>
  This all came as a shock to Sanshir&#333;, and he struggled to grasp what kind of pressure a beam of light could
  have and what function such pressure could possibly serve.

  Crowds gathered before "Woman in Forest" from the day the show opened. The bench turned out to be a useless ornament&mdash;although
  tired spectators would sit there in order <em>not</em> to see the picture. But even while they rested, some exchanged views on "Woman in Forest".

<blockquote>
  In reading, one should notice and fondle details. There is nothing wrong about the moonshine of generalisation when it comes <em>after</em> the sunny trifles
  of the book have been lovingly collected. If one begins with a readymade generalization, one begins at the wrong end and travels away from the book before
  one has started to understand it. Nothing is more boring or more unfair to the author than starting to read, say, <i>Madame Bovary</i>, with the preconceived
  notion that it is a denunciation of the bourgeoisie. We should always remember that the work of art is invariably the creation of a new world, so the first thing
  we should do is study that new world as closely as possible, approaching it as something brand new, having no obvious connection with the worlds we already
  know. When this new world has been closely studied, then and only then let us examine its links with other worlds, other branches of knowledge.

<blockquote>
  She said: 'It is witty to say that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, or that a circle is a plane figure
  bounded by one line, every point of which is equidistant from a fixed centre. It is plain witty. Everyone knows what a straight line
  and a circle are.'
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  Muriel Spark, <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i>, p.82. Penguin Group (2010).

<blockquote>
  The hot new tool in the stealing tools-box is "Generative AI", like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, or Midjourney, which can produce new art, or words, on command,
  using a process known as "Stealing".

<blockquote>
  'But how will you earn your living?' they asked him. 'You can always be a poet as a side line, in your spare time&mdash;but how will you keep yourself?'
  <p>
  One must be kept, swept, turned inside out, shaken free of insects, polished, pleated, trimmed, preserved in brine which is collected in opaque green bottles from the sea or from tears which fall in the intervals between each death.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  From Janet Frame, "The triumph of poetry", in <i>The daylight and the dust: Selected short stories</i>, pp.188&ndash;212. Virago Press (2010).

<blockquote>
  There is an awful moment in popular books on cosmic theories (that breezily begin with plain straightforward chatty paragraphs)
  when there suddenly begin to sprout mathematical formulas, which immediately blind one's brain. We do not go as far as that here.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  Vladimir Nabokov, <i>Ada or Ardor</i>, p.123. Penguin (2015).

<blockquote>
  It is the sure mark of a shallow and ignorant person to be drawn to odd curiosities and delight in unusual explanations.

<blockquote>
  In my childhood I was a fervent worshiper of the tiger. [...] I would stand for hours on end before one
  of the cages at the zoo; I would rank vast encyclopaedias and natural history books by the splendour of
  their tigers. [...] My childhood outgrown, the tigers and my passion for them faded, but they are still
  in my dreams. In that underground sea or chaos, they still endure. As I sleep I am drawn into some dream
  or other, and suddenly I realize that it's a dream. At those moments, I often think: <i>This is a dream,
  a pure diversion of my will, and since I have unlimited power, I am going to bring forth a tiger.</i>
  <p>
  Oh, incompetence! My dreams never seem to engender the creature I so hunger for. The tiger does appear,
  but it is all dried up, or it's flimsy-looking, or it has impure vagaries of shape or an unacceptable size,
  or it's altogether too ephemeral, or it looks more like a dog or bird than like a tiger.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  From Jorge Luis Borges, <i>Dreamtigers</i>. In <i>The aleph</i> (translated by Andrew Hurley), p.143. Penguin (2000).

<blockquote>
  He experienced both bliss and horror in contemplating the way an inclined line, rotating spokelike,
  slid upwards along another, vertical line&mdash;in an example illustrating the mysteries of parallelism.
  The vertical one was infinite, like all lines, and the inclined one, also infinite, sliding along it
  and rising ever higher as its angle decreased, was doomed to eternal motion, for it was impossible
  for it to slip off, and the point of their intersection, together with his soul, glided upwards
  along an endless path. But with the aid of a ruler he forced them to unlock: he simply redrew
  them, parallel to one another, and this gave him the feeling that out there, in infinity, where he
  had forced the inclined line to jump off, an unthinkable catastrophe had taken place, an inexplicable
  miracle, and he lingered long in those heavens where earthly lines go out of their mind.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  Vladimir Nabokov, <i>The Luzhin Defense</i> (translated by Michael Scammwell), p.16. Penguin (2016).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    A polished black sedan was a good subject, especially if parked at the intersection of a tree-bordered street and
    one of those heavyish spring skies whose bloated grey clouds and amoeba-shaped blotches of blue
    seem more physical than the reticent elms and evasive pavement. Now break the body of the car into
    separate curves and panels; then put it together in terms of reflections. These will be different for each
    part: the top will display inverted trees with blurred branches growing like roots into a washily
    photographed sky, with a whalelike building swimming by&mdash;an architectural afterthought; one side of
    the hood will be coated with a band of rich celestial cobalt; a most delicate pattern of black twigs will
    be mirrored in the outside surface of the rear window; and a remarkable desert view, a distended
    horizon, with a remote house here and a lone tree there, will stretch along the bumper.
    <p style="text-align: right">
    &ndash;  Vladimir Nabokov, <i>Pnin</i>, pp.82&ndash;83. Penguin (2016).

<blockquote>
  Now it's the challenger's turn to reply to to this verbal bombardment:<br>
  Neatly each phrase he dissects. with intelligence subtle and keen;<br>
  Harmless around him the adjectives tumble, as he ducks for cover<br>
  And squeaks, 'It depends what you mean.'
  <p style="text-align: right">
  &ndash;  Aristophanes, <i>Frogs</i>, in <i>Frogs and Other Plays</i> (trans. Barrett), p.166. Penguin (2007).
