<blockquote>
  She said: 'It is witty to say that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, or that a circle is a plane figure
  bounded by one line, every point of which is equidistant from a fixed centre. It is plain witty. Everyone knows what a straight line
  and a circle are.'

  -- Muriel Spark, <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i>, p.82. Penguin Group (2010).

<blockquote>
  'But how will you earn your living?' they asked him. 'You can always be a poet as a side line, in your spare time&mdash;but how will you keep yourself?'
  <p>
  One must be kept, swept, turned inside out, shaken free of insects, polished, pleated, trimmed, preserved in brine which is collected in opaque green bottles from the sea or from tears which fall in the intervals between each death.

<blockquote>
  There is an awful moment in popular books on cosmic theories (that breezily begin with plain straightforward chatty paragraphs)
  when there suddenly begin to sprout mathematical formulas, which immediately blind one's brain. We do not go as far as that here.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  -- Vladimir Nabokov, <i>Ada or Ardor</i>, p.123. Penguin (2015).

<blockquote>
  It is the sure mark of a shallow and ignorant person to be drawn to odd curiosities and delight in unusual explanations. (?!)

<blockquote>
  In my childhood I was a fervent worshiper of the tiger. [...] I would stand for hours on end before one
  of the cages at the zoo; I would rank vast encyclopaedias and natural history books by the splendour of
  their tigers. [...] My childhood outgrown, the tigers and my passion for them faded, but they are still
  in my dreams. In that underground sea or chaos, they still endure. As I sleep I am drawn into some dream
  or other, and suddenly I realize that it's a dream. At those moments, I often think: <i>This is a dream,
  a pure diversion of my will, and since I have unlimited power, I am going to bring forth a tiger.</i>
  <p>
  Oh, incompetence! My dreams never seem to engender the creature I so hunger for. The tiger does appear,
  but it is all dried up, or it's flimsy-looking, or it has impure vagaries of shape or an unacceptable size,
  or it's altogether too ephemeral, or it looks more like a dog or bird than like a tiger.
  <p style="text-align: right">
  -- From Jorge Luis Borges, <i>Dreamtigers</i>. In <i>The aleph</i> (translated by Andrew Hurley), p.143. Penguin (2000).

<blockquote>
  He experienced both bliss and horror in contemplating the way an inclined line, rotating spokelike,
  slid upwards along another, vertical line&mdash;in an example illustrating the mysteries of parallelism.
  The vertical one was infinite, like all lines, and the inclined one, also infinite, sliding along it
  and rising ever higher as its angle decreased, was doomed to eternal motion, for it was impossible
  for it to slip off, and the point of their intersection, together with his soul, glided upwards
  along an endless path. But with the aid of a ruler he forced them to unlock: he simply redrew
  them, parallel to one another, and this gave him the feeling that out there, in infinity, where he
  had forced the inclined line to jump off, an unthinkable catastrophe had taken place, an inexplicable
  miracle, and he lingered long in those heavens where earthly lines go out of their mind.

  -- Vladimir Nabokov, <i>The Luzhin Defense</i> (translated by Michael Scammwell), p.16. Penguin (2016).

<blockquote>
    A polished black sedan was a good subject, especially if parked at the intersection of a tree-bordered street and
    one of those heavyish spring skies whose bloated grey clouds and amoeba-shaped blotches of blue
    seem more physical than the reticent elms and evasive pavement. Now break the body of the car into
    separate curves and panels; then put it together in terms of reflections. These will be different for each
    part: the top will display inverted trees with blurred branches growing like roots into a washily
    photographed sky, with a whalelike building swimming by&mdash;an architectural afterthought; one side of
    the hood will be coated with a band of rich celestial cobalt; a most delicate pattern of black twigs will
    be mirrored in the outside surface of the rear window; and a remarkable desert view, a distended
    horizon, with a remote house here and a lone tree there, will stretch along the bumper.
    <p style="text-align: right">
    -- Vladimir Nabokov, <i>Pnin</i>. Chapter 4, section 5.

<blockquote>
  Now it's the challenger's turn to reply to to this verbal bombardment:<br>
  Neatly each phrase he dissects. with intelligence subtle and keen;<br>
  Harmless around him the adjectives tumble, as he ducks for cover<br>
  And squeaks, 'It depends what you mean.'
  <p style="text-align: right">
  -- Aristophanes, <i>Frogs</i>, in <i>Frogs and Other Plays</i> (trans. Barrett), p.166. Penguin (2007).
