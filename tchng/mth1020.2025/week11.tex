\begin{frame}{Week 10, Q11}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with base radius $2~\text{m}$ and height $4~\text{m}$. If water is being
    pumped into the tank at a rate of $2~\text{m}^3/\text{min}$, find the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is $3~\text{m}$
    deep.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Key concepts so far (integration)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definite integral as a Riemann sum. Indefinite integral as anti-differentiation.
  \item Fundamental theorem of calculus.
  \item Area calculation.
  \item Techniques of integration:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Substitution (chain rule)
      \item By parts (product rule)
      \item By partial fractions
      \item By trig identities
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{\inserttitle}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Get into groups of 3-4 people who all prepared a different question in advance.
  \item Write your \textbf{preferred name} and \textbf{ID number} on the whiteboards so I can take attendance
  \item Present your prepared question to each other as I come around, you should only take about 5min each for this.
  \item Then get started on the other questions \textbf{in your groups}.
  \item \textbf{At the end:} please erase the boards and return any markers etc that you used (you do not need to return the handouts)
\end{enumerate}
