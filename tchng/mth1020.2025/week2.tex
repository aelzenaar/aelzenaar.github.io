\begin{enumerate}
  \item There are \textbf{two handouts}: the problem sheet and a sheet of helpful advice. There are whiteboard markers \& erasers in the box.
  \item Get into groups of 3-4 people who all prepared a different question in advance
  \item Write your \textbf{preferred name} and \textbf{ID number} on the whiteboards so I can take attendance
  \item Present your prepared question to each other as I come around, you should only take about 5min each for this.
  \item Then get started on the other questions \textbf{in your groups}.
  \item \textbf{At the end:} please erase the boards and return any markers etc that you used (you do not need to return the handouts)
