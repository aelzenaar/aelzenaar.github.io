  <h1>Alex Elzenaar</h1>

  I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/">Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften</a> in Leipzig under the supervision of <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~joswig/index.html">Prof. Dr. Michael Joswig</a>. I am interested in the interaction between combinatorics and geometry, particularly in algebraic geometry and hyperbolic geometry.

  <h2>MSc. thesis: <i>Deformation spaces of Kleinian groups</i> (submitted Feb. 2022)</h2>
  My Master of Science thesis was completed in 2021-22 in the Department of Mathematics at the <a href="https://auckland.ac.nz">University of Auckland</a>, under the supervision
  of Dist. Prof. Gaven Martin (NZ Institute of Advanced Study, Massey University) and Dr. Jeroen Schillewaert. It is currently under examination and will appear here when the
  corrections asked for by the examiners have been made.

  <blockquote>
  <b>Abstract.</b> It has been known since at least the time of Poincaré that isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space \( \mathbb{H}^3 \) can be represented by \( 2 \times 2\) matrices over the complex numbers: the
  matrices represent fractional linear transformations on the sphere at infinity, and hyperbolic space is rigid enough that every hyperbolic motion is determined by such an action at infinity.
  A discrete subgroup of \( \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}) \) is called a Kleinian group; the quotient of \( \mathbb{H}^3 \) by
  the action of such a group is an orbifold, and its boundary at infinity is a (possibly empty or disconnected) Riemann surface.
  <p> The <i>Riley slice</i> is the moduli space of Kleinian groups generated by a pair of parabolic elements which are free on those generators and whose corresponding surface is supported on a
  4-punctured sphere; Robert Riley introduced this object in the 1970s while studying 2-bridge knot groups. The Riley slice is naturally embedded in \( \mathbb{C} \) and so is particularly amenable to
  study since one can draw pictures of it. Linda Keen and Caroline Series <a href="https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s3-69.1.72">studied this embedding in the early 1990s</a> via a family of polynomials
  which gave a foliation (local product decomposition) of the slice. We will discuss the Keen--Series theory and extend it to allow torsion elements as generators. We also discuss some new results
  of a combinatorial flavour and some applications. We aim for the exposition to be accessible to beginning graduate students, despite the high bar for entry to this subject in terms of prerequisite material.

  <h2>Spherical designs</h2>

  <span style="float:right;width:20%"><img src="tight_frames_project/design.png" alt="A diagram of a spherical design." style="max-width:100%"/><br/>A spherical \((3,3)\)-design in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) of 16 vectors.</span>

  Spherical \((t,t)\)-designs are arrangements of points on the sphere (possibly with weights) which are spaced `far apart from each other': they are finite sets in \( \mathbb{R}^d \)
  such that the integral over the sphere of each homogeneous polynomial of degree \(2t\) in \( d \) variables is equal to its average value on the set. There are generalisations
  of this definition to subsets of \( \mathbb{C}^d \) and \( \mathbb{H}^d \) (the \(d\)-fold product of the Hamiltonian quaternion algebra, not hyperbolic \(d\)-space!).

  <h3>Optimal designs and near-designs</h3>
  <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~waldron/">Shayne Waldron</a> and I have a paper in preparation: <i>Putatively optimal projective spherical designs with little apparent symmetry</i>,
  computing various spherical designs in order to find those of minimal order; a large set of designs and near-designs are archived on on Zenodo
  at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6443357">DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6443357</a>. You can look at the code used to generate these
  on <a href="https://github.com/aelzenaar/tightframes">GitHub</a>; it uses the <a href="https://www.manopt.org/">Manopt optimisation toolbox</a>. This work was was funded in
  part by a University of Auckland Summer Research Scholarship (2019-20). You can view the <a href="tight_frames_project/scholarship_report.pdf">final report</a> for the scholarship.
