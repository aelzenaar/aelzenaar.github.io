  <h1>Alex Elzenaar</h1>

  I (he/him) am at the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/">Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften</a> in Leipzig. I usually work in between the areas of geometric group theory, geometric topology, and metric geometry. I am particularly interested in modern classical geometry (for instance as studied by Coxeter and Thurston) and relationships with other branches of mathematics (knot theory, number theory, algebraic geometry, ...).

  <p>

  I am also interested in visualisation of mathematical objects (including mathematical art) and the study of mathematical writing.

  <blockquote style="max-width:70%; border-left: thick solid black; padding:1em; background: #EEE">
    In my childhood I was a fervent worshiper of the tiger. [...] I would stand for hours on end before one
    of the cages at the zoo; I would rank vast encyclopaedias and natural history books by the splendour of
    their tigers. [...] My childhood outgrown, the tigers and my passion for them faded, but they are still
    in my dreams. In that underground sea or chaos, they still endure. As I sleep I am drawn into some dream
    or other, and suddenly I realize that it's a dream. At those moments, I often think: <i>This is a dream,
    a pure diversion of my will, and since I have unlimited power, I am going to bring forth a tiger.</i>
    <p>
    Oh, incompetence! My dreams never seem to engender the creature I so hunger for. The tiger does appear,
    but it is all dried up, or it's flimsy-looking, or it has impure vagaries of shape or an unacceptable size,
    or it's altogether too ephemeral, or it looks more like a dog or bird than like a tiger.

  <h2>Representation of algebraic curves by Schottky groups</h2>
  <span style="float:right;width:40%;margin-left:2em;"><img src="schottky2.1.000.png" alt="A sculpture in the landscape." style="max-width:100%"/></span>
  What is a Riemann surface?
  <dl>
    <dt>Analytically:</dt><dd>A 2-dimensional manifold (or orbifold) admitting a chart of conformal maps into \( \mathbb{C} \) with conformal transition maps.</dd>
    <dt>Algebraically:</dt><dd>An algebraic curve over \( \mathbb{C} \).</dd>
    <dt>Geometrically:</dt><dd>The quotient of a 2-dimensional geometric manifold by a discrete group of isometries.</dd>
  </ul>

  <p>
  There are two kinds of theorems which relate the different viewpoints. First, theorems on rings of functions: the ring of global meromorphic functions on an analytic Riemann surface
  is isomorphic to a one-dimensional function field over \( \mathbb{C} \) and defines a birationality class of algebraic varieties, setting up an equivalence between the analytic
  and algebraic worlds. Secondly, uniformisation theorems. Traditionally, one uniformises general (genus \( \geq 2 \) ) analytic Riemann surfaces by Fuchsian groups,
  i.e. one writes the surface as a quotient \( \mathbb{H}^2/G \) where \( G \) is a discrete group of hyperbolic isometries and is identified with the holonomy
  group of the surface. However, it is also possible to uniformise all Riemann surfaces by a class of groups of isometries of \( \mathbb{H}^3 \)! This is the class
  of <b>Schottky groups</b>.

  <p>
  In an upcoming paper with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sfairchild/home">Samantha Fairchild</a> and Angel David Rios Ortiz we analyse (following earlier work
  of Rubén Hidalgo among others) the procedure to go from a Schottky group to the corresponding birationality class of algebraic curves.

  <p>
  In addition, some thoughts on <a href="riemann/moduli.pdf">relationships between moduli of Schottky groups and moduli of algebraic curves</a>.

  <p>
  Related to this upcoming paper, I survey the three different worlds and some classical theorems (with many examples of Kleinian and Fuchsian groups)
  in the notes <a href="tchng/riemann.pdf">Uniformisation, equivariance, and vanishing&mdash;Three kinds of functions hanging around your Riemann surface</a>.

  I will teach a minicourse at UoA from <s>16</s> 17--20 Jan 2023. The goal (which will not be achieved, but we will get some way towards it) is to explain the rough structure of the following equivalent
  objects: (i) the moduli space of Schottky groups; and (ii) the space of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with visual boundary a compact Riemann surface (handlebody). In the process we will learn some of
  the Birman theory of braid groups, some knot theory, some of the quasi-conformal deformation theory of Kleinian groups, and a lot of geometric topology. The only prerequisite is comfort thinking
  about quotients in metric spaces and some algebraic topology, but we will go fast and so you should expect to lose track of some details fairly quickly. To try to fix this I will also be handing
  out problem sheets (which will include some "basic" problems, some research level problems, and some computational problems). Each lecture should also be fairly self-contained. People who attended
  the graduate seminar/course I taught in Sem 1 of 2021 will find things easier but it is not necessary at all for you to have followed that. The talk in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nzmri2023">Nelson</a>
  by Benson Farb is also very good preparation.

  I anticipate 5 lectures, at 2PM every day in 303.257 (this schedule is only guaranteed for the first talk, I think some of the more enthusiastic people will want more time to discuss the ideas and
  so we will wing it as we go). The lectures will be:-

    <li>Sociology <a href="tchng/ephemera/problems2.pdf">problems</a>

    <li>Braids, links, and mapping class groups
    <li>???
  </ol>
  I have written some <a href="tchng/ephemera/ephemera.pdf">rough notes</a> which indicate the direction of the conjectured moduli space structure. These notes are not complete.

  <h2>MSc. thesis: <i>Deformation spaces of Kleinian groups</i></h2>
  My <a href="msc_thesis.pdf">Master of Science thesis</a> was completed in 2021-22 in the Department of Mathematics at the <a href="https://auckland.ac.nz">University of Auckland</a>, under the supervision
  of Dist. Prof. Gaven Martin (NZ Institute of Advanced Study, Massey University) and Dr. Jeroen Schillewaert.

  <blockquote>
  <b>Abstract.</b> It has been known since at least the time of Poincaré that isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space \( \mathbb{H}^3 \) can be represented by \( 2 \times 2\) matrices over the complex numbers: the
  matrices represent fractional linear transformations on the sphere at infinity, and hyperbolic space is rigid enough that every hyperbolic motion is determined by such an action at infinity.
  A discrete subgroup of \( \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}) \) is called a Kleinian group; the quotient of \( \mathbb{H}^3 \) by
  the action of such a group is an orbifold, and its boundary at infinity is a (possibly empty or disconnected) Riemann surface.
  <p> The <i>Riley slice</i> is the moduli space of Kleinian groups generated by a pair of parabolic elements which are free on those generators and whose corresponding surface is supported on a
  4-punctured sphere; Robert Riley introduced this object in the 1970s while studying 2-bridge knot groups. The Riley slice is naturally embedded in \( \mathbb{C} \) and so is particularly amenable to
  study since one can draw pictures of it. Linda Keen and Caroline Series <a href="https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s3-69.1.72">studied this embedding in the early 1990s</a> via a family of polynomials
  which gave a foliation (local product decomposition) of the slice. We will discuss the Keen--Series theory and extend it to allow torsion elements as generators. We also discuss some new results
  of a combinatorial flavour and some applications. We aim for the exposition to be accessible to beginning graduate students, despite the high bar for entry to this subject in terms of prerequisite material.
  </blockquote>

  If this sounds interesting, you might want to start with our expository article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11422">Concrete one complex dimensional moduli spaces of hyperbolic manifolds and orbifolds</a>
  which we wrote to give historical and mathematical background: we aimed for this to be accessible to beginning graduate students with only a little complex analysis and topology knowledge.
  My <a href="msc_thesis.pdf">thesis</a> gives more detailed background to the study of quasiconformal deformation spaces and the relevant knot theory and low-dimensional topology, with references to graduate
  textbooks and the original literature, before discussing our new results. For the new results please cite our papers which are based in part on the thesis rather than the thesis itself, as this was joint work:

  <h2>Lorentzian polynomials and algebraic geometry on matroids</h2>
  If \( X \) is a sufficiently nice variety, the Chow group \( A^*(X) \) provides a homology theory on \( X \); in fact, it admits a ring structure coming from the intersection product. It turns out
  that such a theory can be made to work on more general spaces, for example one can define a Chow ring for matroids; then the various Hodge-type results (Poincaré duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem,
  and the Hodge-Riemann relations) carry over. Various nice polynomials can be defined with respect to this generalised Hodge theory and the associated cones of 'ample divisors' (which turn out
  to be submodular functions); these are the <i>Lorentzian polynomials</i> of Brändén and Huh.

  <h3 id="lorentzian_day">A Day of Geometry and Lorentzian Polynomials</h3>
  At the end of May 2022 there was a <a href="http://www.mittag-leffler.se/konferens/goran-gustafsson-symposium">seminar at the Institut Mittag-Leffler</a> on the work of Branden, Huh, Katz, and various
  other people on Lorentzian polynomials and the geometry of matroids; before this event on <b>Tuesday 24 May</b>, I organised a very informal Zoom workshop on some of the geometric background
  material.

  <blockquote>
  <b>Abstract.</b>
  Even if you do not know what Lorentzian polynomials are, you may have heard of Minkowski volume polynomials, the polynomials of the form \( \mathrm{vol}(x_1 K_1 + \cdots + x_n K_n) \)
  where \( K_1,\ldots,K_n \) are convex bodies&mdash;and these are somehow the "canonical examples" of Lorentzian polynomials. The goal of the workshop is to give many different examples of Lorentzian
  polynomials arising in geometry. The talks will be very informal, non-technical, and have many pictures.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Spherical designs</h2>

  <span style="float:right;width:20%"><img src="tight_frames/design.png" alt="A diagram of a spherical design." style="max-width:100%"/><br/>A spherical \((3,3)\)-design in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) of 16 vectors.</span>

  Spherical \((t,t)\)-designs are arrangements of points on the sphere (possibly with weights) which are spaced 'far apart from each other': they are finite sets in \( \mathbb{R}^d \)
  such that the integral over the sphere of each homogeneous polynomial of degree \(2t\) in \( d \) variables is equal to its average value on the set. There are generalisations
  of this definition to subsets of \( \mathbb{C}^d \) and \( \mathbb{H}^d \) (the \(d\)-fold product of the Hamiltonian quaternion algebra, not hyperbolic \(d\)-space!).

  <h3>Optimal designs and near-designs</h3>
  <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~waldron/">Shayne Waldron</a> and I have a paper in preparation: <i>Putatively optimal projective spherical designs with little apparent symmetry</i>,
  computing various spherical designs in order to find those of minimal order; a large set of designs and near-designs are archived on on Zenodo
  at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6443357">DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6443357</a>. You can look at the code used to generate these
  on <a href="https://github.com/aelzenaar/tightframes">GitHub</a>; it uses the <a href="https://www.manopt.org/">Manopt optimisation toolbox</a>. This work was was funded in
  part by a University of Auckland Summer Research Scholarship (2019-20). You can view the <a href="tight_frames/scholarship_report.pdf">final report</a> for the scholarship.

  <h2>College (secondary school) notes on mathematics and physics</h2>
  In 2017&ndash;2020 I was a private tutor to various students in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geography at a variety of levels from NCEA Level 1 (approx. 15 years old) to
  NZ Scholarship (the premier NZ college examinations for high-achieving students). I produced a wide range of teaching materials which have been tested on several different students
  and seem relatively successful on the whole. These materials can be found on a <a href="https://github.com/aelzenaar/ncea-notes">separate website</a>. I no longer tutor privately
  and these notes are not updated any more, but I am happy to give advice or comment on possible errors.
