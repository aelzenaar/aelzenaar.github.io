  <h1>Alex Elzenaar</h1>

  I (he/him) am currently in the School of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/school-of-mathematics">Monash University</a> supervised by <a href="https://users.monash.edu.au/~jpurcell/">Jessica Purcell</a>. I usually work in between the areas of geometric
  group theory, geometric topology, and metric geometry. I am particularly interested in modern classical geometry (for instance as studied by Coxeter and Thurston) and relationships with other
  branches of mathematics (knot theory, number theory, algebraic geometry, complex dynamics...). I am also interested in visualisation of mathematical objects (including art) and the study of writing (mathematical
  or otherwise).

  <h2>Deformation spaces of rank two Kleinian groups</h2>

  <span style="float:right;width:30%;margin-left:2em;"><img src="kg/rileysliceparabolic.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="The Riley slice"/><br/><img src="kg/farey_translates_3_4_3_4.png" alt="A group on an elliptic pleating ray." style="max-width:100%"/><br/><img src="kg/farey_triangulation_realp_700.png" alt="The dual complex to the Farey triangulation." style="max-width:100%"/></span>

  <p>A rank two Kleinian group is a discrete subgroup of \( \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}) \) generated by two elements. If the group is non-elementary, then it is related in complicated and interesting
  ways to hyperbolic 3-orbifolds that have boundary at infinity consisting of a genus two Riemann surface.

  <p>A graph curve is an algebraic curve consisting of a number of thrice-marked spheres, each marked point corresponding to a node (a transverse intersection of two components). Each graph curve
  of genus two comes from a trivalent graph on two vertices and three edges. There are exactly two such graphs: the theta graph (each edge joins both nodes), and the handcuff graph (one edge
  joins the nodes, and the others begin and end on the same node). Both of these graphs are homotopy retracts of the genus two handlebody. Therefore there are only two graph curves of genus two.

  <p>On the edge of the deformation space of 3-manifolds with genus two surface at infinity there lie manifolds with the same configuration of spheres at infinity: pairs of thrice-punctured spheres with
  rank one cusps, with incidence graph a trivalent graph with two vertices and three edges (the incidence graph has vertices correspoding to topological components of the surface and edges corresponding
  to nodes).

  <p>By Thurston's ending lamination theorem (proved for this special case by Minsky and Miyachi), on the boundary of the 3-manifold space you get a different limit for each choice of embedding of the
  trivalent graph into the handlebody, and you can also take limits of such choices to get 'degenerate' orbifolds&mdash;the graphs might even be knotted! Conversely every boundary point arises in this way.
  So there is a very complicated map from the space of these boundary groups (which is basically a Teichmüller space, up to a small quotient) to the space of graph curves (which has two points).
  It turns out that this complicated map is basically reflecting the geometry of two-bridge links. Manifolds on the boundary that correspond to handcuff graphs arise from two-bridge links
  with two components, and manifolds corresponding to theta graphs arise from two-bridge knots. The knots do not live inside the deformation spaces, but they lie on tendrils of discrete groups that creep
  out beyond the moduli spaces.

  <p>The <i>Riley slice</i> is the space of Kleinian groups generated by two parabolic elements such that the quotient manifold is a Conway ball: a 3-ball with two arcs drilled out. Choosing a way of arranging
  these arcs into a rational tangle is equivalent to picking a simple closed curve on the boundary sphere; suppose that this curve is represented by a hyperbolic element \( W_{p/q} \) with trace
  \( \mathrm{tr}\, W_{p/q} < -2 \) in the holonomy group of the manifold (actually, you need to pick the correct component of the set of points where this word is hyperbolic, but this is immaterial for the
  time being). The boundary of the deformation space can be reached by smoothly deforming \( W_{p/q} \) until it is parabolic (trace equals \( -2 \)).
  Keep deforming \( W_{p/q} \) so that its trace decreases; the group is no longer discrete except sporadically, and these discrete groups correspond to replacing the parabolic arc with a cone arc. Eventually
  you reach \( \mathrm{tr}\, W_{p/q} = 2\), and in fact \( W_{p/q} = 1 \). You have now reached the fundamental group of the \( p/q \) 2-bridge link. The arc (which has now vanished to become a solid part of the knot
  complement) is an upper or lower unknotting tunnel for the knot; and the point on the boundary of the deformation space where this arc was parabolic corresponds to the manifold where both the knot and the
  unknotting tunnel have been drilled out as parabolic arcs from \( \mathbb{S}^3 \).

    In July 2024 (University of Auckland) and possibly August 2024 (Monash University) I will teach a seminar on the deformation theory of infinite volume hyperbolic
    3-manifolds; <a href="kg/deformations/abstract.pdf">abstract and background</a>. Notes will appear here. We will cover similar material to <i>Apocrypha and ephemera
    on the boundaries of moduli space</i> as described below but in much more technical detail. Students who have studied differential geometry and complex analysis
    are welcome to attend.

    <blockquote style="max-width:50%">
      <b>Manifesto.</b>
      We look for a computable, geometrically meaningful coordinate system for the space of representations
      \( \pi_1(M) \to \mathsf{PSL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \) where \( M \) is a hyperbolic 3-fold. Work of Thurston, Keen and Series, Gilman,
      Maskit, Kra, Marden, Akiyoshi, Sakuma, Wada, Weeks, Yamashita <i>et cetera</i> gives us hope that such
      a coordinate system exists for discrete and faithful representations, and that continued deformation
      of groups along extensions of coordinate lines continues to give meaningful information about <i>indiscrete</i> groups which represent geometrically related cone manifolds.

    <h3 id="ephemera">2023 seminar: Apocrypha and ephemera on the boundaries of moduli space</h3>

    I taught a minicourse at UoA from <s>16</s> 17-20 Jan 2023. The goal was to explain the rough structure of the following equivalent
    objects: (i) the moduli space of Schottky groups; and (ii) the space of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with visual boundary a compact Riemann surface (handlebody). In the process we will learn some of
    the Birman theory of braid groups, some knot theory, some of the quasi-conformal deformation theory of Kleinian groups, and a lot of geometric topology. The only prerequisite is comfort thinking
    about quotients in metric spaces and some algebraic topology, but we will go fast and so you should expect to lose track of some details fairly quickly. To try to fix this I will also be handing
    out problem sheets (which will include some "basic" problems, some research level problems, and some computational problems). Each lecture should also be fairly self-contained. People who attended
    the graduate seminar/course I taught in Sem 1 of 2021 will find things easier but it is not necessary at all for you to have followed that. The talk in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nzmri2023">Nelson</a>
    by Benson Farb is also very good preparation.
    <p>
    I anticipate 5 lectures, at 2PM every day in 303.257 (this schedule is only guaranteed for the first talk, I think some of the more enthusiastic people will want more time to discuss the ideas and
    so we will wing it as we go). The lectures will be:-

      <li>Braids, links, and mapping class groups
      <li>???

    I have written some <a href="kg/ephemera/ephemera.pdf">rough notes</a> which indicate the direction of the conjectured moduli space structure. These notes are not complete.

  <span style="float:right;width:30%;margin-left:2em;"><img src="zoo/fig8gp.png" alt="The figure eight knot group." style="max-width:100%"/></span>
  There are several useful 'zoos' of Kleinian groups with interesting properties; I collected several interesting groups and families of groups from a few sources,
  and you can find their limit sets <a href="zoo/index.html">on this page</a>.

  <p>
  These images were produced using the <a href="https://github.com/aelzenaar/bella">Bella</a> computational package for Kleinian groups. (Bella stood for <i>Better Limit Set Drawer</i>.)

  A previous version of this package: <a href="https://github.com/aelzenaar/riley">Riley slice computational package (GitHub)</a>. With this earlier package I produced
  <a href="kg/animations/index.html">some animations</a>, and <a href="kg/limit_set_pictures/index.html">some more limit sets</a>. Some more visually impressive animations can be
  found on the website of <a href="https://www.dumas.io/limset3d/">Emily Dumas</a>.

  <h2>Representation of algebraic curves by Schottky groups</h2>

  What is a Riemann surface?
  <dl>
    <dt>Analytically:</dt><dd>A 2-dimensional manifold (or orbifold) admitting a chart of conformal maps into \( \mathbb{C} \) with conformal transition maps.</dd>
    <dt>Algebraically:</dt><dd>An algebraic curve over \( \mathbb{C} \).</dd>
    <dt>Geometrically:</dt><dd>The quotient of a 2-dimensional geometric manifold by a discrete group of isometries.</dd>
  </ul>

  <p>
  There are two kinds of theorems which relate the different viewpoints. First, theorems on rings of functions: the ring of global meromorphic functions on an analytic Riemann surface
  is isomorphic to a one-dimensional function field over \( \mathbb{C} \) and defines a birationality class of algebraic varieties, setting up an equivalence between the analytic
  and algebraic worlds. Secondly, uniformisation theorems. Traditionally, one uniformises general (genus \( \geq 2 \) ) analytic Riemann surfaces by Fuchsian groups,
  i.e. one writes the surface as a quotient \( \mathbb{H}^2/G \) where \( G \) is a discrete group of hyperbolic isometries and is identified with the holonomy
  group of the surface. However, it is also possible to uniformise all Riemann surfaces by a class of groups of isometries of \( \mathbb{H}^3 \) by considering
  action on the boundary at infinity.

  <p>
  I survey the three different worlds and some classical theorems (with many examples of Kleinian and Fuchsian groups)
  in the notes <a href="riemann/riemann.pdf">Uniformisation, equivariance, and vanishing&mdash;Three kinds of functions hanging around your Riemann surface</a>.
  In addition, some thoughts on <a href="riemann/moduli.pdf">relationships between moduli of Schottky groups and moduli of algebraic curves</a>. Notes
  on <a href="riemann/automorphic.pdf">\( G \)-automorphic functions</a> for \( G \) Kleinian.

  <h2>Lorentzian polynomials and algebraic geometry on matroids</h2>
  If \( X \) is a sufficiently nice variety, the Chow group \( A^*(X) \) provides a homology theory on \( X \); in fact, it admits a ring structure coming from the intersection product. It turns out
  that such a theory can be made to work on more general spaces, for example one can define a Chow ring for matroids; then the various Hodge-type results (Poincaré duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem,
  and the Hodge-Riemann relations) carry over. Various nice polynomials can be defined with respect to this generalised Hodge theory and the associated cones of 'ample divisors' (which turn out
  to be submodular functions); these are the <i>Lorentzian polynomials</i> of Brändén and Huh.

  <h3 id="lorentzian_day">A Day of Geometry and Lorentzian Polynomials</h3>
  At the end of May 2022 there was a <a href="http://www.mittag-leffler.se/konferens/goran-gustafsson-symposium">seminar at the Institut Mittag-Leffler</a> on the work of Branden, Huh, Katz, and various
  other people on Lorentzian polynomials and the geometry of matroids; before this event on <b>Tuesday 24 May</b>, I organised a very informal Zoom workshop on some of the geometric background
  material.

  <blockquote>
  <b>Abstract.</b>
  Even if you do not know what Lorentzian polynomials are, you may have heard of Minkowski volume polynomials, the polynomials of the form \( \mathrm{vol}(x_1 K_1 + \cdots + x_n K_n) \)
  where \( K_1,\ldots,K_n \) are convex bodies&mdash;and these are somehow the "canonical examples" of Lorentzian polynomials. The goal of the workshop is to give many different examples of Lorentzian
  polynomials arising in geometry. The talks will be very informal, non-technical, and have many pictures.
  </blockquote>

  Spherical \((t,t)\)-designs are arrangements of points on the sphere (possibly with weights) which are spaced 'far apart from each other': they are finite sets in \( \mathbb{R}^d \)
  such that the integral over the sphere of each homogeneous polynomial of degree \(2t\) in \( d \) variables is equal to its average value on the set. There are generalisations
  of this definition to subsets of \( \mathbb{C}^d \) and \( \mathbb{H}^d \) (the \(d\)-fold product of the Hamiltonian quaternion algebra, not hyperbolic \(d\)-space!).

  In 2017&ndash;2020 I was a private tutor to various students in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geography at a variety of levels from NCEA Level 1 (approx. 15 years old) to
  NZ Scholarship (the premier NZ college examinations for high-achieving students). I produced a wide range of teaching materials which have been tested on several different students
  and seem relatively successful on the whole. These materials can be found on a <a href="https://github.com/aelzenaar/ncea-notes">separate website</a>. I no longer tutor privately
